>>>> sudo su - hadoop


Step 6: Start the Hadoop cluster

To start the Hadoop cluster, you will have to start the previously configured nodes.

So let's start with starting the NameNode and DataNode:

>>>> start-dfs.sh

start the NameNode and DataNode in Hadoop cluster in ubuntu

Next, start the node manager and resource manager:

>>>> start-yarn.sh

start the node manager and resource manager to start the Hadoop cluster in ubuntu

To verify whether the services are running as intended, use the following command:

>>>> jps

check running services for Hadoop cluster in ubuntu
Step 7: Access the Hadoop web interface

To access the Hadoop web interface, you will have to know your IP and append the port no 9870 in your address bar:

http://server-IP:9870


get server ip:
>>>> hostname -I




# start-all.sh & stop-all.sh 
>>>> start-all.sh

Create tmp Directory

Create a tmp directory within the HDFS storage layer. This directory is going to store the intermediary data Hive sends to the HDFS:

>>>> hdfs dfs -mkdir /tmp

Add write and execute permissions to tmp group members:

>>>> hdfs dfs -chmod g+w /tmp

Check if the permissions were added correctly:

>>>> hdfs dfs -ls /


Create warehouse Directory

Create the warehouse directory within the /user/hive/ parent directory:

>>>> hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hive/warehouse

Add write and execute permissions to warehouse group members:

>>>> hdfs dfs -chmod g+w /user/hive/warehouse

Check if the permissions were added correctly:

>>>> hdfs dfs -ls /user/hive



if shows name node is in safe mode
>>>> hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave




================================
Thrift interface to Hive
>>>> hive --service hiveserver2

run hive in background
>>>> nohup hive --service hiveserver2 > hiveserver2.log 2>&1 &
check log
>>>> tail -f hiveserver2.log








==============================
run shell script on another user
>>>> sudo -u hadoop /path/to/your/script.sh
